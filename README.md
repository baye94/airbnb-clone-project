## 🔐 6. API Security

### Key Measures
- **Authentication**: Implemented using JWT to verify users and protect endpoints.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access to restrict operations (e.g., only hosts can list properties).
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects APIs from abuse by limiting requests per user/IP.

### Why Security Matters
- **User Data Protection**: Sensitive information like emails and passwords must be secured.
- **Transaction Safety**: Payments and booking details need encryption and secure validation.
- **System Integrity**: Prevents unauthorized actions and malicious attacks on endpoints.

---

## 🚀 7. CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) automates the process of testing and deploying code. Every change goes through build, test, and deployment stages without manual intervention.

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing, linting, and deployment pipelines.
- **Docker**: Packages the app into containers for consistency across environments.
- **Heroku / Vercel / AWS**: Used for hosting and deploying the application.
